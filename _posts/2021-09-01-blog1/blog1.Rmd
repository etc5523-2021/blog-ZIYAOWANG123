### Data Description

This blog has used two main data sets as the base for the construction of data communication regarding COVID-19 information.

#### Data Source 1 - R Package `nCov2019`

The data set is collected from various sources for different relevant information.  
 - Latest data of corona virus cases from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)  
 - Historical data of corona virus cases from [JHUCSSE](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)  
 - Vaccine data from [raps.org](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker)  
 - Therapeutics data from [raps.org](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-therapeutics-tracker)  

This data source contains two core parts. First one is the GUI explorer section which has a function of `dashboard` to use a simple and interactive dashboard for information communication. Second part is the CLI analysis which includes a work flow from data query to data operation and lastly the visulization output of both geographic and animation plots. 

This blog will __*focus on the CLI analysis part*__, which will query the update COVID-19 data from five different aspects. It will include the "latest update COVID-19 info.", "global COVID-19 info.", "historical COVID-19 info.", "vaccine details", "therapeutics status and progress".
